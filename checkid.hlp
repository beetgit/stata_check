Title

    checkid -- checks for or displays the number of
    unique IDs in the dataset. Can also list number
    of obs per ID.


Syntax

    checkid [no. of unique obs] , id() [noexit] [case()] [gen()] [options]

    options               Description
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Main
      id()              The ID variable name (required).
      noexit            Do not exit program if the number of variables and/or
                        observations is/are different from expected.
      case()            The case variable, to count the number of unique
                        cases per unique ID
      gen()             Used with case to generate a variable showing the
                        number of cases per unique ID.
      genall            The default is to generate the unique ID only for the
                        first observation of the unique ID. Specifying *genall*
                        will essentially repeat that number across all the
                        unique IDs (similar to running a carryforward/backward)
                        command.

Description

    checkid checks for the number of unique IDs there are in the dataset. If
    no expected number of unique observations (by ID) is given, checkid
    simply presents the number of unique IDs present in the dataset.

    If a number is specified, the program will end, by default if the number
    of unique IDs is different from the expected number. The noexit option
    can be used if the user does not want the program to exit.

    A second use, is that when *case* is specified, the program will sum the
    number of unique *case* observations each ID has. This can be used with
    the *gen* option to generate a new variable which has the number of
    unique *case* each ID has, note that this new variable will have only
    one value per ID, where there are more than one of each unique ID, only
    one ID will have the number of cases, the rest will have missing values.

Remarks

    For detailed information on the whatever statistic, see [R] intro.


Examples

    . checkid 150, id(name) noexit
      Checks there are 150 unique entries in variable name. Do not exit
      program if the numbers are different
    . checkid, id(name)
      Check the number of unique IDs there are in the dataset.
    . checkid, id(patientID) case(CaseNo) gen(number_of_cases) genall
      Generates a new variable number_of_cases that contains the number
      of unique CaseNo in for the particular patientID. Where there are
      multiple observations of patientID, the number_of_cases will be
      repeated among all of such observations.
